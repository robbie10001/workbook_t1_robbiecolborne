###ASSESSMENT QUESTIONS

#####Q1. Research the development of the internet from 1980 to today. You must describe at least FIVE key events in the development of the internet. You can refer to events, people of significance, or technologies and how they have changed over time.

######1985 first .com 

Originally, it was planned that .com domains would be reserved for commercial operations. However, in the modern-day .com websites are used by a variety of organisations with a plethora of agendas, besides commercial activity. Nevertheless, the establishment of .com was an important moment in the commercialisation of the internet. The first .com published was by symbolics.com (still active). By 2017, e-commerce sales had reached 29 trillion dollars per year. 

######1989 First Internet Service Provider

In 1989, The Internet was still mainly a technology employed at universities, by governments and some organisations. However, this began to change when Barry Shein, created the first commercial enterprise which offered individuals access to the World Wide Web using dial-up technology. Shein, was at the time the president of the Internet Service Provider, (ISP) “The World”. An ISP is just a term for a company or organisation that offers access to the internet. The proliferation of ISP’s reduced the technical threshold for participation on the internet and therefore made the web more accessible globally. 

######1989 The Creation of The World Wide Web 

In 1989, Tim Berners-Lee a software engineer at CERN and an alumni of Oxford University invented the World Wide Web. Berners-Lee articulated his goals in a paper entitled "Information Management: A Proposal”. The web was developed with the goal of automating information-sharing between scientists at universities and other institutions. Tim Berners-Lee was inspired by the desire to integrate the maturing technologies of computers, data networks and hypertext into a global information system. The World Wide Web has since become the primary way in which people globally interact with the internet. 

######1990 Archie- The First Search Engine 

The first internet search engine create was named Archie. Archie allowed users to search for specific files and was created by Alan Emtage. In terms of functionality, Archie was far less sophisticated than modern search engines and served a far more specific function. Nevertheless, search engines are a critical part of modern day internet usage. The desire of businesses to appear near the top of search engine results has created a whole industry in the establishment of SEO (search engine optimisation) companies. 

######2000- The .com bubble bursts. 

The growth of the internet and the increased usership of the web, led to an economic speculative bubble forming from the mid 1990s which finally burst in 2000. The bubble was the result of speculation regarding the value of internet companies and their potential earnings in the future. At this time, the commercialisation of the web was in no way mature, so people’s investment in the web were particularly speculative. When the bubble burst, many .com business were forced to close. The NASDAQ index would not recover to pre-burst levels until 2015. 


#####Q.2 Define the features of the following technologies that are essential in terms of the development of the internet:

######Packets 

Packets consist of data that is exchanged between an origin and a destination through the use of the internet. Data is sent between the user and recipient(s) in a loop. This data is send continually in small data packages. This alleviates the need to send data all at once and creates a more reliable method of data transference. Packets are a very fast way of data transference. The importance of packets in the development of the internet is in their reliability as a method of data exchanged between devices. This has facilitated the growth of the interconnected network that is the internet. 

######IP addresses (IPv4 and IPv6)

An internet Protocol Address (IP) is a unique number all devices have on the internet. IPv4, was the first internet protocol released in 1983, and consists of a 32-bit address which facilitated the creation of more than 4 billion unique IP addresses. It was unforeseen that 4 billion may not be enough. However, in 1993, IPv6 was established. IPv6 consists of a 128-bit address that allows 340 undecillion unique address. IP addresses are important in the development of the internet as they allow computers to communicate with each other directly and correctly through the use of their unique IP address as a point of reference. 

######Routers and Routing 

A router is a piece of hardware that facilitates communication between a local network and the wider internet. Routers act to prevent unauthorised access to a network and allow the transference of data packets between computers. Routing is akin to a road network, in which data is moved along between devices on the highway (other routers) until it is received and unlocked by the intended recipient. The importance of routers and routing is that they provide a means of efficient communication across networks, have security implications and can allow networks to remain operational in the event of disruptions. These features have helped facilitate the growth of the internet by creating a method by which data is transfered in a secure and reliable manner. 

######Domains and DNS 

All websites have a unique number. An analogy is often given, in which a websites unique number is a kin to a physical address in the real world. In order to make the internet more accessible, and to prevent the need to remember a wide array of different numbers domain names are used and kept in DNS servers. DNS servers, act like an address book and facilitate the translation of domain names into IP address. The importance of domains is that they make the internet far more accessible. The importance of DNS is that they facilitate the use of domain names by bridging the gap between userability and technology. These technologies have therefore made the internet more accessaable and have enabled the growth and development of the internet as a whole. 

#####Q3. Define the features of the following technologies that are essential in terms of the development of the internet:

######TCP 

TCP stands for Transmission Control Protocol, and is one of the protocols in TCP/IP networks. TCP enables a connection to be created for the exchange of data between two devices. TCP, stores the information, transmits the information and then reassembles the information when it is received on the other end. This responsibility is different to the IP (internet provides) which acts to ensure that data is sent to the correct destination. TCP achieves this goal through the following method. Firstly, before any data is sent, a TCP connection must be established between the device sending the data and the device receiving the data. TCP is a reliable method for data transferal in that once data is sent, an acknowledgement is sent back by the receiving device informing the sender that the information has successively arrived. Therefore, if the data does not reach its destination for any reason, the data will be resent after a certain period of time making TCP a reliable method of data transferal. Additionally, TCP is able to reorder data if it becomes mixed on route to its destination. Holistically, this makes TCP an effective, reliable way of transmitting data across the internet. 

######HTTP and HTTPS 

HTTP stands for HyperText Transfer Protocol. HTTP was original designed to receive HTML documents only and deliver them to clients. However, over time it evolved and was altered so that eventually it became the most convenient way to reliably move different data types on the internet. HTTP is now able to deliver any type of data as long as both computers are able to read it. HTTP follows the client/server model. Anytime we open a webpage we are using HTTP and are going through this cycle. Our web browsers are  the client side of this model whereas the server side is the applications we are connecting too. HTTPS stands for Hyper Text Transfer Protocol Secure. HTTPS encrypts all the data that is send using Secure Sockets Layer and or Transport Layer Security (SSL/TLS). When we send sensitive data like our credit cards across the internet it is important that HTTPS is employed.

######Web Browsers (requests, rendering and developer tools) 

Web browsers are applications that allow us to access information that is hosted on the internet. Examples include Internet Explorer (1995), Safari (2003), Firefox (2004), and Google Chrome (2008). They allow us to visit webpages and interact with these pages. For example, by making payments, playing web based games or even accessing our government data. We can think of web browsers as the portal we use that enables us to actually partake in using the internet. Anytime we want to visit a website we create a request. Everytime a user makes a request on any given webpage that said webpage is individually create in response. Webpages do not sit on a server fully compiled and ready for access. Instead, they are compiled and then rendered everytime a new request is made. The elements that make up the website may not even be stored together, so requests act to put everything back together and allow a functional website to be accessible for the user.  Rendering is controlled by the rendering engine. This engine translates data (such as HTML/CSS) to form instructions which define the appearance and functionality of a website when it loads for a user. Developer tools enables web developers to do a wide variety of things. They also web developers to make realtime adjustments to their code, alter their code to error check and test design and aesthetic changes to their pages without needing actually save these changes within their code. Developer tools also enable the user to inspect a page’s HTML, CSS and JavaScript elements. Chrome Developer tools, even allows you to do audits of your webpage which allows you to assess a webpage in terms of it performance, accessibility, best practice and search engine optimisation. Developer tools are a great resource for web developers. 

#####Explain how each technology has contributed to the development of client and server communication over the internet (50 - 150 words for each technology)

######What is client/server communication?

When a computer requests anything it is acting at the client. For example, if I want to download something my computer is the client. Whatever computer or piece of hardware that is able to process this request is known as the server. This process is known as the client-server model. 

######Web Browser 

Anytime a user opens a webpage it becomes the client. The server, is able to interpret and translate this request and send back data which then allows the client to view a web page and interact with it. This client/sever relationship has had a tremendous influence on the development of the internet. For example, e-commerce functions due to the client/sever model. On a more fundamental level, this relationship allows us to successfully open webpages and view and interact with its contents. Holistically, this has enabled e-commerce to emerge and has facilitated the global growth of the internet. 

######HTTP/HTTPS 

The client/server relationship in HTTP allows a client to request information from the internet that is then sent to the client via servers. HTTP now allows various data types to be requested and received through the client-server model. HTTP/HTTPS has facilitated the development of client/server communication by creating a secure method for the transference of data (especially sensitive data) through the internet. 

######TCP 

TCP has facilitated the development of client/serve communication over the internet by providing a secure method for the transmission of data between devices. Information is stored, transmitted and reassembled when it is received by the client. When a client requests data a TCP connection is made between the client and the server holding this data. TCP is a reliable method for data transference using the client/server relationship in that the server will continually send the information until an acknowledgement is send from the client computer indicated that the data has been received. This makes TCP an effective and reliable method for client/server data transference. This in-turn has facilitated to the development of reliable communication between clients and servers over the internet. 

#####Q.4  Identify THREE data structures used in the Ruby programming language and explain the reasons for using each.

In Ruby, a data structure is a way that we can access data and also organise it. The data structure we choose to employ us dependant on what goals we are trying to achieve. ‘

######Hashes 

Hashes are at their core, a collection of key-value pairs. We can think of hashes using the common example of a dictionary. To use a hash we assign a value to its key and we look up these value(s) by accessing the key. For example,

height = {
    :robbie=>"tallest",
    :hamish=>"tall",
    :garret=>"average",
    :harry=>"extremely short"
}
puts height[:harry]

In this example, we print out “extremely short”. 

We can see that hashes are very useful when we have a list in which we know what value we want to assign to a given key.  

######Arrays 

Arrays are a data structure that is able to store other things. The most commonly used analogy I have heard is that it’s a bag in which we put things. Arrays are awesome in that they can contain within them different data types. Arrays are really useful when we use loops as a way of gathering results. They are also useful when we want to gather data from a program. 

######Tree 

A tree is a data structure that has a root value and subtrees of children. We can think of this in a genealogical sense. At the root you have a grandparent, who may have multiple children, who may have multiple children. Trees are useful in that they allow us to organise a list and find values in the list that start with a specific prefix. 

#####Q.5 Describe the features of interpreters and compilers and how they are different.

A compiler is a program that is able to translate code, that we have written using a high level language such as Ruby. High-level basically means that it’s a more human friendly language. A complier takes this code and then translates it into more computer readable code which is then run by the computer. Computers are unable to understand high-level languages and therefore requires the code to be translated into what it does understand, namely binary. 

Conversely, an interpreter is a computer program that converts a statement in a language like ruby into binary. Interpreters and compilers to the same thing in that they convert high-end languages into binary. However, a compiler will convert code into binary before the program runs, whereas interpreters convert the code into binary after the program is run. A compiler converts our program all at once, whereas an interpreter does this line by line. Another difference is that with a compiler our program is compiled before we run our program whereas with an interpreter our program is compiled and run at the same time. Lastly, in terms of speed and errors, a compiler is faster and errors are displayed following the program running all at the same time. Whereas with an interpreter errors are shown line by line. 

#####Q.6  Identify TWO commonly used programming languages and explain the benefits and drawbacks of each.

######Ruby/Ruby on Rails

Speaking from personal experience as someone who is new to programming, one of Ruby’s and therefore Ruby on Rails greatest advantages is that it is a top-level language and was created to be especially human friendly. This makes it a great language for new programmers as it is relatively easy to understand and use. Ruby is also very logically which enhances its userability. This usability also enables programs to be implemented quickly and reliably. Also, Ruby has a large community of committed developers which makes it easy to troubleshoot problems and issues with our programs. Not only this, but it also means that there as a large community that acts as resource for developers using Ruby. 

One of the major drawbacks for Ruby is that it is considered to have an unreasonable runtime speed, in other words, it’s slow. This would be a problem for large complicated programs and can be considered a major drawback of ruby. It is also argued that will more complicated programs using large amounts of gems and files take a long time to load and therefore the program becomes slow to initialise. Another argument I have found on the web is that Ruby lacks good documentation. However, This maybe the case for more advanced programming as I have certainly so far not found this to be the case. 

######JavaScript 

One of the most cited advantages of JavaScript on the internet is its speed. This is because JavaScript runs immediately unless it requires external resources. It is also fast, because it is an interpreted language and this reduces the time required by other programming languages to compile. Other advantages often cited is the JavaScript is very popular and that it is simple to use. Without having experience using JavaScript I cannot comment, only to say that it appears very technical from my inexperienced point of view. It’s popularity is a result of all current browsers supporting it. Its popularity is shown in that it is user by many large companies such as Uber, Facebook, eBay and Google. 

The biggest drawback of JavaScript is that it's not particularly secure. This is due to the fact that the code executes on a users’ computer and can be used by those with malicious intent. This is the biggest disadvantage of JavaScript, the code is visible to everyone. Other disadvantages of JavaScript is that it is argued that it can be slow to execute. Another argument is that JavaScript is a dated language and that other technologies achieve the same result in a more efficient manner. Lastly, it is argued that JavaScript can be rendered differently by different engines. This leads to a lack of consistency across engines in-terms of function and the interface which is displayed. 

#####Q.7(i) Identify TWO ethical issues from the areas below and discuss the extent to which an IT professional is ethically responsible in terms of the issue. Word count guide: 200 - 400 words for each ethical issue

Ethical responsibility is a very difficult concept. This is because what is considered ethical behaviour is culturally dependent and always in a state of flux. However, I will address these questions through the viewpoint of my own view philosophy regarding my own ethics responsibilities. 

######freedom of thought, conscience, speech and the media

One of the key foundational values of liberal democracy is the thought that an individual should have the liberty to express their conscious, and have freedom of speech without hinderance. This however has a single caveat, in that one may not necessarily use these liberties if they prevent others from being able to use their own liberties.  I consider it impossible to interfere with ones freedom of thought as I’m unaware of any method that would restrict this right. Another key element, is the notion of a free media which is not suppressed by the state. Any person who values their liberties, I would argue, has a responsibility to uphold these values, IT professional or not. I would consider it unethical for myself to deliberately engage in conduct as an IT professional that would hinder the ability of others to express their conscience, right to free speech or act to censor the media. However, given the enormity of the internet, it is often the case that only a single view is promoted or that others with differing opinions are not given a forum to express these views. In my mind, this is an unethical use of the internet. I would consider it my ethical responsibility not to work for such an organisation. However, given the scope of the internet a single IT professional can have minimal impact on these issues. That does not however relieve them of their own responsibilities to conduct themselves in an ethical manner. 

######criminal acts such as theft, fraud, trafficking and distribution of prohibited substances, terrorism

As an IT professional, one has the knowledge to use the internet in ways which are not ethical or legal. It is therefore the responsibility of an IT professional to conduct themselves in a manner which is both ethically and legally sound. It should go without saying that if one finds themselves engaged in theft, fraud, trafficking, terrorism or the distribution of prohibited substances they are not acting legally or ethically. If one was to have knowledge of any of these events taking place they would have a legal obligation to inform the authorities. In terms of my own views of morality and my own ethical disposition I find it difficult to think of an example in which one would not also have an ethical responsibility to report such criminal behaviour. As an IT professional, you are better placed than the average person to come across illicit behaviour on the internet. In my mind, it would be an ethical and legal responsibility to report to the appropriate authorities any such unlawful behaviour. Once again, given the scope of the internet, a single IT professional can only do so much. Unless one wants a career within law enforcement, our ethical responsibility is limited to conducting ourselves ethically and within the scope of the legal system. 

#####Q.7(ii) For each ethical issue identify a source of legal information relating to the ethical issue and discuss whether the law if helpful in assisting a developer to act in an ethical way.  Word count- 200 words max. 

It is important to note that legal requirements do not necessarily convey an ethical obligation. Laws can often be seen as unethical and one should not allow laws to dictated what they consider ethical without consideration of the nature of a given legislation itself. Additionally, our legal system is reactionary, in that legislation is created most often to deal with an existing issue rather than to safeguard from a potential issue. 

#####Freedom of Thought, Conscience, Speech and the Media

The Legislation 

Criminal Code Amendment (sharing of abhorrent violent material) Bill 2019 (Commonwealth).

This act was the result of the live steaming of the Christchurch mosque shooting. This amendment requires websites that host audio and visual material to quickly remove this material if it contains "abhorrent violent conduct". There is also a legal responsibility to report such events to the authorities. Those who do not adhere to these requirements face fines up to 10.5 million dollars or 10% of annual revenue and or jail time for the individuals responsible. 

Analysis 

It is my view that anyone who deliberately attempted to gain from such horrific events would not be acting ethically. The law provides a legal obligation to remove content but I would argue that an ethical responsibility to not profit off the suffering of others existed before the legislation. I would argue that the law is subject to the interpretation of courts and therefore it could potentially encroach on the liberties of a developer who maybe acting in an ethical manner. It is my belief in this case, that a negative potential side-effect of this legislation is that informative content could be construed as promoting “abhorrent violent conduct” and that an ethical developer may find themselves forced to censor content. Therefore, I do not think this amended act assists developers in acting in an ethical manner.  

######criminal acts such as theft, fraud, trafficking and distribution of prohibited substances, terrorism 

The Legislation

Section 192E of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW)

Fraud is committed when a person, by way of deception, dishonestly obtains property belonging to another or obtains any financial advantage or causes financial disadvantage

Section 192B of the Crime Act 1900 (NSW)

defines deception as conduct by a person that causes a computer, machine or electronic device to make a response that a person is not authorised to cause it to make

Analysis

These pieces of legislation spell out to a developer what behaviours are considered fraud when conducting themselves on the internet. Legal obligations are are rather blunt instrument for creating ethical behaviour. I would argue most developers know if their behaviour is ethically and legally sound. If they find themselves needing to look up the legal definition of fraud, it would seem to be a solid indication that they are not acting in a particularly ethical fashion. If a developer was unsure of how to conduct themselves, this legislation could act as a guide in terms of how to conduct themselves ethically. However, I would argue that if this was required the developer would likely have many issues when attempting to use the internet in an ethical manner. 

#####Q.7(iii) Conduct Research into a case study of ONE of the ethical issues you have chosen discuss how an ethical IT professional should respond to the case study and how they might mitigate or prevent ethical breaches. (word count 400-600 words)


#####SATYAM SCANDAL (2009)

The Satyam Scandal occurred in 2009, when Indian based internet technology (IT) Satyam Computer Services Limited (SCSL) was found to have engaged in fraudulent behaviour. The IT services company was based in Hyderabad. Primarily, the company offered software development, system maintenance, packaged software integration and engineering design services. The company was founded in 1987 and by 2008 had an annual revenue of 2 billion dollars (US) and employed over 50,000 people worldwide. By the time of the scandal, SCSL was one of the biggest players in the Indian IT market. 

The companies fraudulent activities came to light in January 2009, when chairman Byrraja Raju (who was eventually sentenced to seven years in prison) confessed that corporate accounts had been falsified. Raju admitted that earning reports had been falsified. The company therefore fooled investors, with 94% of the cash on the books being wholly fictions. In the aftermath, of Raju’s confession that share-price sunk leading to losses of over 2 billion dollars to investors. 

Raju is quoted summing up the scandal as follows: “We started with a margin hap between actual operating profits and what was reported…which continued to grow over the years…this became unmanageable as the size of the companies operations grew”. 

If effect what occurred was an initially small scale deception which over time became a multi-billion dollar breach of trust of investors. The stimulus for the whole scandal was a lack of ethical business behaviour. These breach could have been mitigated or prevented by greater oversight of the company through either internal checks or external checks. Having greater transparency of the company’s operations would also likely of resulted in the fraud being identified earlier on. 

Additionally, the implementation of ethical business practices would have prevented any fraud from taking place initially. There also seems to be an issue it terms of company culture. As is often the case with publicly listed companies, financial success was the sole motivating concern in regards to the behaviours of the company. If the company culture was more focused on ethical behaviour and the delivery of quality services it is likely that it could have weathered financial hardships. 

This scandal could also have been prevented if the company had used external auditors to go over their financial records. This would have had the effect of preventing the company from having the internal ability to cook the books. 

In terms of how an IT professional running this company should have acted one could do the following. Employ external auditors to ensure that company finances are monitor by an external organisation. This would prevent any temptation to engage in fraudulent behaviour. Employ best business practices and ethical decision making. These would prevent any fraudulent behaviour regardless of temptation. Have an ethos in which increasing profit margins is not the only consideration of value the business has. While profits are important to a publicly listed company investment can be attracted by having ethical business practices and a reputation for this could have allowed the company to survive a financial hardship without resulting to fraud. 

#####Q.8 Explain control flow, using an example from the Ruby programming language (100 words)

In Ruby we have different control flow statements. Control flow allows our programs to choose a certain path in our program based on which condition(s) are meet. Control flow allows our program to skip over certain lines of code if they don’t fulfil our conditions. An example of control flow in Ruby is an if/elsif/else statement. 

age = 61

if age <= 18
    puts "Enjoy being a kid"
elsif age >18 and age <60 
    puts "You are a full-blown adult"
else 
    puts "you are gettin on a bit!"
end 

In this example, the line with “you are gettin on a bit!” will run as neither of the conditions for our if or elsif statement are meet. 


#####Q.9 Explain type coercion (100 words)

Type coercion occurs in Ruby when we change an existing bit of data with its own data type to a different data type. Type coercion is really useful when we need to change the type of data we receive from external sources. An example, of this would be from user input or from information from an external database. 

puts "how it going from 1 to 10?"
user_input = gets.chomp.to_i 
if user_input <= 5 
    puts "how can i help?"
elsif user_input >=6 and user_input <=10
    puts "your doing fine"
else 
    puts "try again"
end 

In this example, we had to convert the user input from a string into an integer in order for the program to run without error. If we didn’t do this we would get a type error as ruby doesn’t understand how to compare the user_input which is a string with integer that is 5. This is accomplished by using the .to_i method. 

#####Q.10 Explain data types, using examples (100 words)

Data types are the classification of different elements that we use within out programming. In Ruby, we have symbols, strings, hashes, arrays, booleans and numbers. Data types are essential for programmers in order to make sophisticated programs. Additionally, data types allow our compiler to figure out how we are going to use our data. Examples of different data types 

# Numbers 

# float
puts 1.0
# integer
puts 1
# String 
puts "one"
# Array 
one = ["one", 1, 1.0,  ]
puts one[0]
# Hash 
one = {
    :one => "one",
}
puts one[:one]
# Boolean 

if true 
    puts "one"
end 
#Symbol 
one = :one 
puts one 

This results in a print out of “one” in all the different data types as follows. 
1.0, 1, one, one, one, one, one 

#####Q.11 Here’s the problem: “There is a restaurant serving a variety of food. The customers want to be able to buy food of their choice. All the staff just quit, how can you build an app to replace them?”

#####Q.12 Identify and explain the error in the code that is preventing correct execution of the program (100 words)

celsius = gets
fahrenheit = (celsius * 9 / 5) + 32
print "The result is: "
print fahrenheit
puts “."

The error in the code is that gets returns a string. Therefore when we go to the second line, the computer reads it as 

Fahrenheit = (“words” *9/5) + 32 

This of course makes no sense to the computer. To fix the problem we need to convert user input into a number, namely a float for a more accurate program. In order to do this, we use the .to_f method. 

The computer now reads the second line as 

Fahrenheit =(float *9/5) + 32 

So for example, if user input was 20.5, the computer would read the following 

Fahrenheit=(20.5 *9/5) + 32 

Which allows the program to run and print to the user 68.9. 

#####Q.13 The following code looks for the first two elements that are out of order and swaps them; however, it is not producing the correct results. Rewrite the code so that it works correctly.

arr = [5, 22, 29, 39, 19, 51, 78, 96, 84]
i = 0
while (i < arr.size - 1 and arr[i] < arr[i + 1])
    i = i + 1 end
puts i
    arr[i] = arr[i + 1]
    arr[i + 1] = arr[i]

arr =[5, 22, 29, 39, 19, 51, 78, 96, 84]
i = 0 
while (i < arr.size - 1 and arr[i] < arr[i + 1])
    i = i + 1 
end 

puts i

ricky = arr[3]
arr[i] = arr[i + 1]
arr[i + 1] = ricky
p arr 

This question is somewhat vague. I’m not sure if we are supposed to swap the 19 and 39 or order the whole array correctly. Either way I’ve swapped the 19 and 39 by creating a third variable that allows me to alter the answer without creating duplicate code. 

[5, 22, 29, 39, 19, 51, 78, 96, 84]
39
[5, 22, 29, 19, 39, 51, 78, 96, 84]

#####Q.14 Demonstrate your algorithmic thinking through completing the following two tasks, in order:

Seeing as 0 and 1 are not prime numbers we can start our count at 2. We need to check every number starting at 2. We also need to stop when we reach 100. To do this we need to create a function “Areyouaprime”. This function needs to loop trough all numbers from 2 to 100. If we come across a prime we add it to a counter. If the number is not a prime we restart the loop and continue the loop at the next sequential number. We continue our loop until we reach 100. At this point we print out the list of prime numbers.

#####Q.15 Write pseudocode OR Ruby code for the following problem:

You have access to two variables: raining (boolean) and temperature (integer). If it’s raining and the temperature is less than 15 degrees, print to the screen “It’s wet and cold”, if it is less than 15 but not raining print “It’s not raining but cold”. If it’s greater than or equal to 15 but not raining print “It’s warm but not raining”, and otherwise tell them “It’s warm and raining”.

raining = false
temperature = 20

if raining and temperature<15 
    puts "It's wet and cold"
elsif temperature <15 and !raining 
    puts "It's not raining but cold"
elsif temperature >=15 and !raining
    puts "It's warm but not raining"
else 
    puts "It's warm and raining"
end 

#####Q.16 
An allergy test produces a single numeric score which contains the information about all the allergies the person has (that they were tested for). The list of items (and their value) that were tested are:

eggs (1)
peanuts (2)
shellfish (4)
strawberries (8)
tomatoes (16)
chocolate (32)
pollen (64)
cats (128)
So if Tom is allergic to peanuts and chocolate, he gets a score of 34.

Write a program that, given a person’s score can tell them: a) whether or not they’re allergic to a given item b) the full list of allergies.

For this question, I don’t think I can complete it give my current technical skills. I thought I would pseudocode what I think needs to be done to write a program that would work. 

Firstly, i would create a hash containing the scores and allergies. For example, 

allergies_score ={
    "1" => "eggs",
    "2" => "peanuts",
    "4" => "shellfish",
    "8" => "strawberries",
    "16" => "tomatoes",
    "32" => "chocolate",
    "64" => "pollen",
    "128" => "cats",
}

Secondly, i would create an array that holds all of the different allergies, 

full_list_of_alergies = ["eggs", "peanuts", "shellfish", "strawberries", "tomatoes", "chocolate", "pollen", "cats"]

Thirdly, i would create a method which would be able to use a patient score to give me a list of the allergies that patient has.

Finally, i would print this. 

Given the values associated with each allergy a think every number would create a unique list of allergies. I think a loop through the numbers until it extracted the alergies for the given value would be my best bet. However, I don’t currently have the technical skills to achieve this goal.
